## Background Story
![intro-meme](/screenshots/intro-meme.png)

Lately, I've realized that I have a tendency to be a bit of a spendthrift. To better manage my finances, I decided to experiment by tracking my daily expenses. This way, I could request pocket money from my parents that would be sufficient to cover my monthly expenses. I needed a tool that would allow me to instantly record any purchase I made on the spot before I forgot about it. Additionally, I wanted to be transparent with my parents and accountable for every single coin I spent.

I envisioned a solution where I could divide the money I received into essential categories like food and school expenses, and allocate the remaining funds to entertainment. I needed a way to track how much I had left in each category at any given moment, from anywhere. This approach would help me spend my remaining funds wisely and avoid making random calls to my parents for money at unexpected times, especially when they might not have any to spare.

As a result, I developed a web application that enables me to monitor my spending and meet my budgets. This application not only helps me manage my finances better but also fosters accountability and transparency with my parents.

I wrote a detailed blog post about the development of SpendSmart, covering the challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented. You can read it [here](https://medium.com/@murithimichael254/spendsmart-portfolio-project-b91f2cf85149).

## TECH STACK I USED

![web-architecture](/screenshots/spendsmart-architecture.png)

**Frontend**

**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: For structuring the content, styling the application, and adding interactivity.
**Flatpickr** Library: Chosen for date picking functionality due to its ease of use and integration with JavaScript, enhancing the user experience by providing a visually appealing and user-friendly date picker.

**Backend**

**Python**: Selected for its simplicity and readability, allowing for rapid development and ease of maintenance.

**Flask:** A lightweight web framework  to create the backend of the application. I chose it for its simplicity, flexibility, and fine-grained control over the application's components.

**SQLAlchemy:** An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that allowed for easy interaction with the database using Python objects, reducing the complexity of writing raw SQL queries and improving code maintainability.

**Database Management**

**MySQL**: Chosen for its robustness, reliability, and widespread use. I prefered it owing to its efficiency in data storage and retrieval, ensuring the application can handle multiple transactions and queries efficiently.

**Deployment**

**HAProxy**: Employed for load balancing and SSL termination, and reverse proxying, ensuring high availability, reliability, and security of the application. 

**Nginx**: Used it as a web server for serving the application, motivated by its reputation for  high performance, stability, and low resource consumption. Nginx is also played a crucial role for handling static files(html, css , jquery and images).

**Gunicorn**: Used it as wsgi application server to run the Flask application, providing a robust and scalable way to serve the web application.

From the response, we can see:
- "Movie Night" expense ID: `469c3cfc-e310-435b-bbcd-a9d7c7742430`
- "Entertainment" collection ID: `c8384cd4-f32b-4f36-91fb-d3aecff9899c`
- "Miscellaneous" collection ID: `5b751d95-3618-45bf-aa00-7c881e7861c6`
- User ID: `ee95989a-20a1-41d9-bb18-131c649b91cc`
- to transfer `Movie night` expense to `miscellaneus` budget:
```
adminpc@mike:~/spendsmart$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:5011/api/v1/users/ee95989a-20a1-41d9-bb18-131c649b91cc/expenses/469c3cfc-e310-435b-bbcd-a9d7c7742430 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{

  "user_id": "ee95989a-20a1-41d9-bb18-131c649b91cc"
}
```
- from the above oberve that the expense `collection_id` is now pointing to `Miscellaneus`
- Also, now if i list all collections with their expenses, `Movie Night` expense now should belong to `Miscellaneous` collection

--------------------------------------

## What's Next?
In the upcoming iterations, I plan to implement the following enhancements:

**Summary Section**: Introduce a summary feature where users can view analysis for the total amount spent daily, weekly, or monthly.

**Expense Allocation Across Budgets**: Enable expenses to be assigned to multiple budgets, allowing simultaneous monitoring across different durations (e.g., weekly and daily).

**Automatic Budget Monitoring**: Automate the setup of budget monitoring once a duration period ends, reducing the need for manual user intervention.
